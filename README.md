# Node Word Guess
A newer iteraton of my hangman game. This version is solely represented as a [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) app.

## Player Game Flow
* **User guesses letters to be compared against a randomly generated word**
    * If a letter is correctly guessed, all matches for the user's letter-guess are revealed within the randomly generated word, **_unless_** the entire word has been correctly guessed. In this case the player's score increases and a new word is generated to guess. 
    * **_or_**
    * If a letter is guessed incorrectly, decrease the players amount of guesses **_unless_** they've already used all their guess.In this case, the game ends and displays their number of words guessed correctly.
